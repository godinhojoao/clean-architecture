## Domain
- Business rules with usecases and entities.

## Data layer
- Implementing the usecases from domain.

## Presentation
- Making the controllers following the usecases from domain and using the data layer by dependency injection at the time of instantiate the controller classes. Adapting the domain to the technology.

### Infra
- Used to create the repositories from repository pattern, but it don't have any relation with clean architecture even that is an interesting combination.

### Main
- Used as "dirty layer / corruption layer" out of clean architecture, just to compose all the layers and "instantiate" the application. As suggested by Uncle Bob.
